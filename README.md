# Abstract

Windows Presentation Foundation is what people are using to build real applications for the enterprise, the industry, the workplace, and for every situation where Windows 10 Universal isn't quite ready yet. Far from being dead, WPF is 10 years old this year, and it's still alive and kicking. It gives Universal Applications a run for their money. In this session, you'll learn what is new in Windows Presentation Foundation, where it's going in the future, and what you can achieve with WPF that Universal Application developers can only dream of. We'll also see how these two roads cross and how existing WPF applications can be brought to Windows 10 using the Centennial bridge. Finally we'll discover new features and tools recently implemented for WPF developers.
